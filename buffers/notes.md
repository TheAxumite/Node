1. **Node's Memory Allocation for Buffers**:
   - Node.js does pre-allocate a pool of memory for the efficient management of small `Buffer` objects. This pool is a slice of Node's heap allocated for the purpose of reducing the overhead of creating many small `Buffer` instances.

2. **Size of the Buffer Pool**:
   - By default, Node.js allocates 8 kilobytes (KiB) for this buffer pool when the buffer module is loaded. This value can be checked by logging `Buffer.poolSize`, which is correct.

3. **Using Buffer Pool**:
   - It is not accurate to say that you can only use this pool if the size of the allocation is `floor(poolSize / 2)`. The buffer pool is used for allocating `Buffer` objects that are smaller than 8 KiB (by default). When you create a `Buffer` using `Buffer.allocUnsafe()` smaller than the pool size, it will use this pool. The `allocUnsafe()` method will allocate a buffer of the specified size regardless of the pool, but for sizes less than or equal to the pool size, it will use the pool.

4. **`Buffer.allocUnsafe(10000)`**:
   - This will indeed allocate a `Buffer` of 10,000 bytes. If the buffer pool is enabled, and the requested size is within the pool size, it will allocate from the pool. However, since 10,000 bytes is larger than the default pool size (8 KiB), this particular allocation would not use the pool but rather directly allocate memory outside of the pool.

5. **The `>>>` Operator**:
   - The `>>>` operator is the zero-fill right shift operator in JavaScript. It shifts the first operand the specified number of bits to the right. Excess bits shifted off to the right are discarded. Zero bits are shifted in from the left. This operator can effectively perform a floor division by 2 when used with `>>> 1`, but this analogy only holds for non-negative integers. 

6. **`Buffer.poolSize >>> 1`**:
   - This expression would indeed divide `Buffer.poolSize` by 2 and floor the result for non-negative numbers, which is a way to quickly calculate half the pool size. However, it is not accurate to state that "you can only make use of this pool if the size of the allocation has to be floor(poolSize / 2)".

In summary, while the information presented is based on real aspects of Node.js's Buffer implementation, some clarifications are needed regarding the use and behavior of the buffer pool and the `allocUnsafe` method. The buffer pool is typically used for small `Buffer` allocations, and `Buffer.allocUnsafe()` can allocate a buffer of any size, not necessarily tied to the pool size. The `>>>` operator does perform a bit-wise shift that can mimic the behavior of flooring a division by 2 for non-negative integers.
